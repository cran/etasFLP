Title: Mixed FLP and ML Estimation of ETAS Space-Time Point Processes
        for Earthquake Description
Version: 2.2.1
Date: 2023-07-17
Description: Estimation of the components of an ETAS (Epidemic Type Aftershock Sequence) model for earthquake description. Non-parametric background seismicity can be estimated through FLP (Forward Likelihood Predictive). New version 2.0.0: covariates have been introduced to explain the effects of external factors on the induced seismicity; the parametrization has been changed; Chiodi, Adelfio (2017)<doi:10.18637/jss.v076.i03>.
