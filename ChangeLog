*R package etasFLP: changes from version 1.3.1 to version 1.4.0
*general changes: added a CITATION file with the reference to the JSS (Journal of Statistical Software) article (the DOI in the CITATION is for a new JSS publication that will be registered after publication on CRAN) 
*plot.etasclass: added tfixed and totfixed in the output.

*R package etasFLP: changes from version 1.3.0 to version 1.3.1
*general changes: used different Fortran compiler options to avoid some warnings in the CRAN Package Check Results page

*R package etasFLP: changes from version 1.2.1 to version 1.3.0

*general changes: bug corrected in flp computation. Results obtained with previous versions can have little differences with the present ones.
*etasflp.integral: function etasflp.integral has been dropped out; it is useless in the flp optimization step. 
*etasclass.Rd, summary.etasclass.Rd, profile.etasclass.Rd: changed the magnitude threshold of the example, so that the whole data of "italycatalog" are used.


*R package etasFLP: changes from version 1.2.0 to version 1.2.1
 
*etas.starting: corrected a bug when using geographical coordinates (the routine is still a beta-version)

*etasclass: now as input catalog an object of class eqcat or data.frame can be given. Inserted a better choice of the starting values of the bandwidth passed to the function flp1.etas.nlm in the flp step

*R package etasFLP: changes from version 1.1.1 to version 1.2.0
 
*etas.starting: new function  to estimate starting values (beta-version)

*plot.etasclass: added several plot for diagnostic and residual analysis (ten plots in four windows)

*plot.etasclass: Corrected a bug for the computation of integrated triggered intensities

*plot.etasclass: Checked a bug when "backconstant=TRUE"

*simpson.kD: the function now is exported for end users

2014-10-30  Marcello Chiodi  <marcello.chiodi@unipa.it>

*R package etasFLP: changes from version 1.1.0 to version 1.1.1

*summary.etasclass.R: Corrected a bug in printing the output

2014-10-27  Marcello Chiodi  <marcello.chiodi@unipa.it>

*R package etasFLP: changes from version 1.0.3 to version 1.1.0

*compare.etasclass: added the function "compare.etasclass" to compare two "etasclass" objects

*etasflp.integral: a bug has been fixed

*plot.etasclass: changed some default values. Added the optional argument "tfixed"; if specified, the triggered intensity estimated at day "tfixed" is plotted

*etasclass:  changed some default values. Added the optional argument "longlat.to.km": if "TRUE" the long and lat are considered geographical coordinates; input initial values for "hdef" (bandwidths) and "w" (weights)
can be given;


2014-04-14  Marcello Chiodi  <marcello.chiodi@unipa.it>

*R package etasFLP: changes from version 1.0.2 to version 1.0.3

*NAMESPACE: improved the import export instructions; S3 methods explicitly registered. Only few functions of the package are explicitely exported.

*etasclass: improved the printing of some execution message, avoiding "print()".


2014-03-27  Marcello Chiodi  <marcello.chiodi@unipa.it>

*R package etasFLP: changes from version 1.0.1 to version 1.0.2

*etasclass.R: Corrected two bugs (when the hessian has a determinant close to zero, and when onlytime =TRUE); added the argument "method", used only if "usenlm=FALSE": method used  by "optim"; the use of the starting background catalog ("cat.back")  has been improved. 

*plot.etasclass: Corrected a bug in the computation of back.grid.

*magn.plot: The argument "..." has been added, so that graphical options can be passed to customize graphical output.

*etasFLP-manual.pdf: Some correction has been made in the documentation  files. 

2014-02-10  Marcello Chiodi  <marcello.chiodi@unipa.it>

*R package etasFLP: changes from version 1.0.0 to version 1.0.1

*print.etasclass.R: function added. S3 method for
the generic function print for objects of class "etasclass".

*print.etasclass.Rd: added documentation file for the new function "print.etasclass.R".

*californiacatalog.RData: a new data set added to the package with a North California earthquake catalog. Documented in the help file "californiacatalog.Rd".

*californiacatalog.Rd: added documentation file for the new data set "californiacatalog.RData".

*DESCRIPTION file: Avoided dependency on package "car"; external packages "fields", "rgl", "maps", "mapdata" declared in "Imports" row instead of "Depends" row, due to a note present on the CRAN test page.

*plot.profile.R: small changes to the titles of the plots. 

*summary.etasclass.R: small changes to the output format.

*etasclass.R: the input argument params.ind now is is a logical vector (default is the same: replicate(8,TRUE)); instead of a vector of 0 and 1; the meaning is the same.
Corrected a bug in the comparison between the successive declustering iterations
In the  output the  element "this.call" has been added and contains the call of the function.
Corrected and improved some headers in the names of the output elements 

*plot.etasclass: added two new input arguments: "PDF" and "file"; if "PDF=TRUE" then the output is sent to pdf file with name "file".
Some plot label and titles have been corrected.

*profile.etasclass.Rd: correction in the item nprofile.
